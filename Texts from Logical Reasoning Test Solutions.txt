Questions I got wrong 

test 12 

q1
Step 1	
In the sequence there is one diagram containing a shape with an odd number of edges followed by two diagrams which each contain a shape with an even number of edges. Thus, in the next figure, there must be a shape with an even number of edges, leaving options B and E.

Step 2	
The colour of the shapes also follows a sequence: two black, one white, two black, etc. Therefore, the shape in the next figure must be white, leaving options A and E.

q4
Step 1	
The triangle in the centre rotates by 90 degrees clockwise and turns white on every third diagram. In the correct answer the triangle must therefore be black and aligned as it appears on Figure 2, leaving options B and D.

Step 2	
There is always an odd number of black circles in each diagram. The grey circles change from an odd to an even number on every diagram.Thus, in the next figure, there must be an odd number of black circles and even number of grey circles, leaving options C and D.

q6
Step 1	
Two shapes appear in turns: a circle or a moon. In the correct answer, the shape must be a moon leaving options B, C and E.

Step 2	
The arrow determines the position and colour of the shape in the following diagram. Since the arrow is white and facing leftwards, the shape must be located in the top left corner and be white, giving B as the correct answer.
